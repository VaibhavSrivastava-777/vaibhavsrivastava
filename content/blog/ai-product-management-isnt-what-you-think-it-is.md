excerpt: "AI Product Management isn't about chasing the latest models or adding chatbots to every feature. It's about understanding where AI creates defensible value versus where it's just commodity infrastructure. Most AI PMs fail because they think in features, not systems—and their products degrade silently while they're not watching."

<p>Many people wrongly assume AI Product Management is about chasing the latest model capabilities or sprinkling AI features into existing products. In reality, it's rooted in core product management principles: problem framing, data strategy, customer empathy, user trust, and continuous iteration. It is NOT just 'plug and play AI'.</p><p><strong>The Feature Trap: Why Strategic Thinking Beats Model Selection</strong></p><p>The most common mistake I see is people thinking in features rather than systems. They ask "Should we use GPT-4 or Claude?" before asking "What user problem are we actually solving?"</p><p>Take Spotify's Discover Weekly. The genius wasn't choosing a particular recommendation algorithm—it was designing a system where user listening behaviour creates a data flywheel. Every skip, replay, and playlist addition makes the product smarter. The AI PM's job was architecting that feedback loop, not picking the fanciest ML model.</p><p>Success requires asking "what outcome does this drive for users?" before "which foundation model should we use?" AI PMs must think in systems: How will the model improve over time? What data advantages does this create? Where can competitors replicate this, and where can't they?</p><p><strong>The Unsexy Truth: Data Quality Beats Model Sophistication</strong></p><p>Ask most people what an AI PM does with propensity models, and they'll describe someone analysing precision-recall curves for each customer segment.</p><p>In reality, most of my time goes to unglamorous foundational work: ensuring training data represents all user demographics, establishing consistent labelling standards, building governance frameworks that prevent garbage data from poisoning models. Great models built on poor data foundations fail every time.</p><p>Consider Amazon's same-day delivery prediction system. The differentiator isn't a sophisticated algorithm—it's years of meticulously labelled data on what "customer is home" actually looks like across thousands of neighbourhoods, seasons, and events. When a model predicts delivery success, it's built on millions of correctly labelled outcomes: doorbell cameras, reception confirmations, weather patterns, local holidays.</p><p>This is where AI PMs add value: not obsessing over the latest research papers, but ensuring the data pipeline captures ground truth accurately, represents edge cases fairly, and updates as the world changes.</p><p><strong>AI Products Decay: The Monitoring Challenge Nobody Talks About</strong></p><p>The word "AI" misleads people into thinking products can be set-and-forget. The reality is harsher: AI products degrade silently.</p><p>What worked in January may fail by June as user patterns shift. Netflix's recommendation engine doesn't just learn once—it continuously adapts as viewing habits evolve (pandemic binge-watching versus normal patterns, new show releases shifting preferences, seasonal trends). Unlike traditional products where a checkout flow ships and stays consistent, AI products require constant vigilance.</p><p>This demands capabilities most product orgs lack: instrumentation to detect when model performance drifts, systems to retrain efficiently without disrupting users, and organizational processes to act on warning signals quickly. When Zillow's home-buying algorithm started overvaluing properties in 2021, the drift happened gradually—but the business impact was sudden and severe. They shut down Zillow Offers entirely, laying off 25% of staff.</p><p>AI PMs must build early warning systems: dashboards tracking not just accuracy metrics, but user trust signals, edge case frequency, and data distribution shifts. The product never stops learning because the world never stops changing.</p><p><strong>The Narrow Intelligence Reality: When Humans Must Stay in the Loop</strong></p><p>AI is not a replacement for human judgment—it's a powerful tool with a narrow beam.</p><p>AI excels at pattern recognition across millions of transactions but catastrophically fails at edge cases requiring context. GitHub Copilot can generate boilerplate code brilliantly, but a senior engineer must still review for security vulnerabilities, architectural fit, and business logic correctness. The AI handles the repetitive 80%, humans handle the crucial 20%.</p><p>This is where product design matters most. Stripe's Radar fraud detection flags suspicious transactions with high accuracy, but deliberately routes ambiguous cases to human review. Why? Because falsely declining a legitimate customer's first purchase might lose them forever, while a sophisticated fraudster making an unusual but genuine purchase needs human judgment to distinguish intent.</p><p>PMs must design products that keep humans in the loop where stakes are highest: medical diagnoses need doctor confirmation, content moderation needs human review for cultural context, financial approvals need oversight for unusual circumstances. Automation should augment judgment, not eliminate it.</p><p><strong>What Actually Separates Good AI PMs from Great Ones</strong></p><p>The AI PMs who thrive aren't chasing every model release or cramming LLMs into every workflow. They're the ones who deeply understand where AI creates defensible value versus where it's commodity infrastructure.</p><p>As foundation models become increasingly accessible—everyone can call the same APIs—competitive advantage shifts to proprietary data, thoughtful human-AI interaction design, and earned user trust.</p><p>The risks worth watching:</p><p><strong>Hype-driven roadmaps</strong>: Building AI features because competitors have them, without clear user value. Adding a chatbot because "everyone has AI now" typically creates support burdens, not delight.</p><p><strong>Data blind spots</strong>: Ignoring bias or underrepresented segments. When Apple Card launched with AI-driven credit limits, it faced backlash for gender discrimination—the algorithm learned from historically biased lending patterns.</p><p><strong>Over-automation</strong>: Removing human judgment where it's essential. Fully automated customer service might optimize for deflection rates while destroying customer relationships.</p><p><strong>Trust gaps</strong>: Users rejecting AI outputs due to lack of transparency. When LinkedIn started using AI to suggest profile edits, adoption was low until they showed <em>why</em> each suggestion would help—transparency built trust.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward</strong></p><p>The future belongs to AI PMs who treat artificial intelligence as an ingredient, not the recipe. Who build trust through transparency. Who know when to automate and when to augment. Who understand that the hardest problems in AI products aren't technical—they're human.</p><p>The question isn't whether to build with AI. It's whether you're solving a real problem, building on solid data foundations, designing for continuous learning, and keeping humans in the loop where judgment matters most.</p><p>That's AI Product Management. Not plug and play. Not set and forget. Strategic, systematic, and relentlessly focused on creating genuine user value.</p>
